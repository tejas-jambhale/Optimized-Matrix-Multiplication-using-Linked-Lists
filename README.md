# polynomialpython
An implementation of polynomials and its related functions in C++ using linked lists

This project was created for my DSA Class in College

It is an implementation of polynomial manipulations and various functions using linked lists.

A structure has been used to create linked list node for the polynomial elements and switch case is used to call desired function
